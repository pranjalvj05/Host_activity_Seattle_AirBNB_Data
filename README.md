In this dataset I explore some insights and try to answer these three questions :

##### Question 1: What are the monthy changes occuring in price influence by the neighborhood?
answer : Analysis shows that neighbourhood  have great influence on the listing price as the prices are different in every neighborhood we can see that Downtown has high price rates

##### Question 2 : What are the features that affect the prices?
answer: we found that price is highly correlated with bathrooms, bedrooms, accomodates and beds. So there features affect the price as the price is higher the pace is good and luxirious.

##### Question 3: What are the changes in price according to seasons?
answer: we found that prices are also affected by month as in summer prices might lower than in winter.

###### I also used XGBoost Regressor Model for predicting the price and important features that affect the price rates.
